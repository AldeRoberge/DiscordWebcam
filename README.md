# DiscordWebcam

How to set up :

You will need :

- A Discord Bot
- A Discord channel (with the channel ID)
- A local or network webcam

DiscordWebcam supports many cameras, from local to IP.

To set up a old android cellphone as a webcam, simply download 'IP Webcam'.

Once the camera is up and running, add the camera in the software. The IP should look like : http://192.168.0.115:8080/video

DiscordWebcam will be minimised to tray on close.
